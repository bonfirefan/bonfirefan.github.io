title: City Scrapers in Pittsburgh: Fall 2018
---

# 2019: New Year Scrapings
Thank you to everyone who has been a part of this project so far. This update will be slightly different from the ones in the past - feel free to skip it and just note our next couple of meetings on your 2019 calendar.

We'll be holding biweekly meetings starting January 25, 2019 Fridays 6:30-8:30pm at Code & Supply.

RSVP for the next one [here](https://www.meetup.com/codeforpgh/events/257675406/).

# 2018: A Season of Spiders
Thank you all to those that joined us in our Fall 2018 meetings:

* CMU Campus: 8/31, 9/14, 9/21, 9/28, 10/12, 10/26, 11/9
* Code&Supply: 11/2, 11/16, 12/7, 12/14

We created 2 new PA spiders, with two more open pull requests and 13 spiders in progress!

# A hopeful community of coders
In the end, City Scrapers got brought over to Pittsburgh because I personally didn't want to let go of the City Scrapers community. A great chunk of my engagement with the project should be credited to one of the other Chicago code contributors, Rebecca Wei, who first gently reached out to me to see if I would be interested in helping organize the coding community past the initial Fall 2017 sprint, and who I borrow the hope of creating the kind of coding community we wanted, rather than adjusting to existing institutions.

Prior to the "Future of Civic Tech" event, we only had the capacity to host in a CMU Heinz academic setting. There was a natural fit for Information Systems and Policy/Analytics students looking for a project to learn from while contributing to an open source project. After encountering a warm welcome in the Pittsburgh civic-minded community of technologists, academics, journalists and public servants, the community really took off.

However, when it comes to "diversity in tech," in addition to having a justice-oriented mission, we need to actually create connections with diverse communities. This is the "resolution" we carry forward into 2019.

# Future Directions
In reality, after leaving 2018's Allied Media Conference, it became clear that an educational component to the project was important. To become fully inclusive, the City Scrapers project should be incorporated into a workshop curriculum, similar to the portable Django Girls Workshop, as an introduction to webscraping and contributing to Open Source. The significant changes that Pat Sier has worked into the project in removing invoke dependencies and adding pipenv documentation has cut down the onboarding time significantly. The first Code & Supply meetup on 11/2 was the first we had ever had an entire group successfully set up the project environment. In Chicago, newcomers always encountered a roadblock or bug to contribution and it would take 2-3 meetups before fully onboarding. After adding the pipenv documentation and removing invoke, envrionment setup time was cut to 30 minutes to an hour (by more than half!). Though the open nature of the project makes it inherently more challenging than Django, there's a definite possibility and roadmap.

Additionally, each time the project is introduced, it becomes clear that a public-facing calendar of similar to Every Public Meeting would be very valuable. Folks interested in this direction should show up at future meetings to discuss.

#404 Public engagement: The fragmented nature of public engagement from a citizen's perspective reflects the fragmented nature of government itself.

This should come as no surprise to anyone, and yet the degree of fragmentation means that the Pittsburgh Office of Community Affairs itself was tasked with putting together a central calendar of open meeting events (sound familiar?) for the Mayor himself. He wanted to stay informed and even stop by if possible - but he didn't know when they were happening. (I learned this after a meeting with them - I'm not sure if this is public knowledge). In fairness, I would surprised if any mayor actually knew all the public meetings in their city given the general lack of centralization.

One of the earliest examples of this disconnect occurred with the Chicago Red Line Extension meetings. Rebecca posted an issue, asking "why isn't this showing up in our scraped meetings?" I opened up the issue on my work computer at CTA, and scratched my head.

After spending a month at the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure, a new bureau created that combines responsibilities and authorities among engineers and planners alike (Department of Transportation, Department of Public Works, Department of City Planning), this disjointed notification posting style seems utterly natural for major capital improvement projects. Overburdened project managers are tasked with the public comment component of their projects, which means that there are a variety of public notice styles - posting flyers on-location, notifying community partners and tasking them with notification (through their own Facebook, newsletter or email channels).

Add to this the slow pace of government digitalization. When reviewing the Open Meetings Acts for most regions, in cases where there is a requirement to post online at all, the language still haltingly re-orients from a carbon-copy process - posting on the website is considered an equivalent to "Posting Onsite" in Illinois, for example. We have already encountered in Pittsburgh meetings that are missing online, but "posted in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette."

I'm commenting mainly on capital improvement projects, especially from a development standpoint. When it comes to public safety, education, utilities and so forth, there are similar if not exacerbated issues with disjointed meeting notifications. Another key difference is that these project meetings are all differ from regularly scheduled board meetings in fundamental alterations that directly affect the community - whether it be in the built environment or transportation access - while having a limited, nonstandard time window for public comment before the design and construction phases of these projects begin.

Public Source had earlier on considered a Documenters-like presence in rural areas surrounding Pittsburgh. In asking which public agencies they were most concerned with covering in the region, they sent a priority list focusing on transportation, housing and development in the region. Similarly, after discovering BikePGH's Public Advocacy calendar, I learned that they stayed up-to-date through several different newsletters, Twitter feeds, Facebook feeds in addition to the City website.

The problem with the lack of standardization of public meetings is simply that the message may not reach the people these meetings will affect. This gets at one of the core components of the Documenters program.
