title: Untokening Reflection
---

# 2018 ends
On the Wednesday before the conference (the week I started the DOMI internship), I joined one of the Untokening webinars where they talked about redefining "Safety" (Beyond Pavement, Paint and Place) to reflect the vulnerabilities of marginalized communities, away from enforcement practices and accounting for a complicated and broken relationship with law enforcement. It rang of the same spirit that Oboi (Slow Roll, Equiticity) had laid out in his critique of Vision Zero and Active Trans. There were [additional principles](http://www.untokening.org/updates/2018/1/27/untokening-mobility-beyond-pavement-paint-and-place) that they had laid out: a structure and framework to follow when doing work related to mobility. I wanted more frameworks, but structure to orient me as I continued work in this space with government, mobility and technology - to account for the potential of abuse in a context of power.

Really, this was the place where I really had the space to connect with the Pittsburgh Transportation advocacy community with Pittsburghers for Public Transit, BikePGH, and Pittsburgh Bike Share.

I had first seen PPTtalk at UPitt's Community Cafe. Transport Club at CMU had joined the last BikePGH WMNBike Ride of the year, and Healthy Ride had met with us to talk about doing a small bikeshare ride when the whether was nice. Moving forward, I'm hoping to help with their displacement project to visualize the survey data they collected on transit impact after housing displacement, through Tech4Society.

In the debrief ("Unpacking the Untokening"), at BikePGH's headquarters in Lawrenceville/Bloomfield, there was conversation about continuing meetings between PPT and BikePGH, as well as the possibility of hosting next year's Untokening.
